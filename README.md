# Adobe Hackathon Challenge – Outline Extractor

This project is designed to extract outlines and structured information from PDF collections using NLP and machine learning models.  
The solution is containerized using Docker to ensure consistent and reproducible results.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- **Docker** installed on your system
- Input PDFs placed inside `Collection_1`, `Collection_2`, or `Collection_3`

---

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### 1. Build the Docker Image
Run the following command in the project root directory:

```bash
docker build -t adobe-challenge .
````

---

### 2. Run the Container

You can process any collection by mounting it into the container:

#### Process Collection 1

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD/Collection_1:/app/Collection_1" \
  adobe-challenge \
  python run_analysis.py ./Collection_1/
```

#### Process Collection 2

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD/Collection_2:/app/Collection_2" \
  adobe-challenge \
  python run_analysis.py ./Collection_2/
```

#### Process Collection 3

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v "$PWD/Collection_3:/app/Collection_3" \
  adobe-challenge \
  python run_analysis.py ./Collection_3/
```

## ⚡ Performance Notes

* The first build may take time as it installs all dependencies, including heavy ML/NLP packages.
* Use a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (`venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.log`, etc.) and speed up builds.
* Subsequent builds will use cached layers unless dependencies change.

---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

* **Build taking too long?**
  Make sure your `.dockerignore` excludes large unused directories (like `venv/`).
* **Platform mismatch warnings?**
  You can safely ignore the `--platform` warning or remove the flag if not cross-compiling.
* **Dependency errors (like `sentencepiece`)?**
  Use a stable Python version like `3.11-slim` in the `Dockerfile`.

```

Do you also want me to provide the **optimized `.dockerignore`** along with this final README?  
I can add it as a section so that it’s fully self-contained. Shall I proceed?
